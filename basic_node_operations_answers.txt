1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they
work and what the output was.

sort will sort the file alphabetically

wc will print out the number of lines, words, and characters of commands.js
the output was `86     204    2243 commands.js`

uniq will sort each line and return different lines (no copies)
the output was the commands.js file sorted with no duplicated lines.

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js.
Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

I ran `wc | uniq commands.js` and the output was just a sorted no doubles
of the commands.js file.

6. Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence
while maintaining the original word order and whitespace and return the string.
To improve your problem-solving experience, use the suggested functions to solve
the problem.

function reverseString(userInput){

var string = userInput;
var split = string.split(' ');
var newArr = [];

split.forEach((item, index, array)=>{
  let item2 = item.split('')
  newArr.push(item2.reverse().join('').toString())
});

newArr = newArr.join(' ');
console.log(newArr)
}

reverseString('Hello World')
